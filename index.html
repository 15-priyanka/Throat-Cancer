<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Throat Cancer</h1>
<h3><marquee>Cancer is a class of diseases in which abnormal cells multiply and divide uncontrollably in the body. </marquee></h3>



<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>The risk factors for throat cancer will depend on the type, but here are some factors that may increase the risk of developing oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancer:</p>
<ul>
	<li>smoking</li><li>
high alcohol consumption</li><li>
a diet low in fruits and vegetables</li><li>
exposure to asbestos, in the case ofTrusted Source laryngeal cancer</li><li>
chewing betel quid and gutka, in the caseTrusted Source of oropharyngeal cancer</li><li>
a high body weight</li><li>
being older, as these cancers mostly occur after age 50Trusted Source</li><li>
having Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, which are inherited genetic syndromes</li><li>
having certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV)
oral hygiene habits may play a role
	</li>
</ul>

	<h3 class="third">SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>Signs and symptoms common to cancers that occur in the throat include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>change in your voice</li><li>
trouble swallowing (dysphagia)</li><li>
weight loss</li><li>
sore throat</li><li>
a constant need to clear your throat</li><li>
persistent cough, possibly with blood</li><li>
swollen lymph nodes in the neck</li><li>
wheezing</li><li>
ear pain</li><li>
hoarseness</li>


</ul>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>At your appointment, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. If youâ€™ve been experiencing symptoms such as a sore throat, hoarseness, and persistent cough with no improvement and no other explanation, they may suspect cancer in some part of the throat.</p><p>

To check for throat cancer, your doctor will performTrusted Source a direct or an indirect laryngoscopy or will refer you to a specialist for the procedure.</p><p>

A laryngoscopy gives your doctor a closer view of the larynx. They may use special mirrors to see these areas or insert an endoscope into your throat for a clearer view.</p><p>

A panendoscopy allows the doctor to see the larynx, esophagus, mouth, nasal cavity, and possibly the lungs at one time. If cancer is present in one location, it can also occur in other areas prone to the same risk factors, such as smoking.</p><p>

If these tests show changes that could indicate cancer, your doctor may order a tissue sample to be taken (called a biopsy) for testing.</p><p>

They will also order imaging tests, such as an X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, or ultrasound to help get a correct diagnosis. Blood tests cannot show if cancer is present in the mouth or throat, but they can help assess your overall health.</p><p>

If your doctor needs more detail about your gullet, you may need to have an X-ray after drinking a chalky liquid called a barium swallow. The barium swallow helps show any problems with the gullet on an X-ray.</p><p>

A bone scan can show if cancer has spread to the bones.</p>

<p>Treatment options for throat cancer include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
